      <p>Safe drivers, rejoice! With Vanishing Deductible from Nationwide, you can earn $100 off your deductible for every year of safe driving.

      The last thing you want to worry about after being in an accident is coming up with hundreds of dollars to fix your car. With Vanishing Deductible, your safe driving can help lower your deductible by up to $500 – and that’s peace of mind for anyone on a budget.

      How does Vanishing Deductible work?
      Vanishing Deductible is an optional feature. You’ll earn $100 off your deductible for each year of safe driving, up to $500. Your deductible could vanish completely. Why not be rewarded for something you’re already doing?

      Here’s an example: Let’s say you have a $500 deductible. After three years of safe driving with Vanishing Deductible, you’ll earn a $300 credit. If you have an accident, you would pay just $200 toward your deductible before your insurance starts to cover any damages.

      And if you do have an accident, you don’t have to worry about your deductible going all the way back up to $500. Your Vanishing Deductible reward would be reset to $100, still providing you savings.

      Vanishing Deductible is an optional feature. Annual credits subject to eligibility requirements. Maximum credit: $500. Details and availability vary by state.</p>
